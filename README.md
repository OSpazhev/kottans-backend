Kottans courses

[Git basics](https://github.com/kottans/backend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md) -- very useful and interesting course. I've been working with git for a year but used only simple commands like commit, checkout, merge. This course broadened my view, moreover, I think about git in another way. And the biggest influence on it was made by [one of the references to self study resource from udacity course](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
