## [Git basics](https://github.com/kottans/backend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)
Very useful and interesting course. I've been working with git for a year but used only simple commands like commit, checkout, merge. This course broadened my view, moreover, I think about git in another way. And the biggest influence on it was made by [one of the references to self study resource from udacity course](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

## [Unix shell](https://github.com/kottans/backend/blob/master/tasks/unix-shell.md)

### Impressions
(1) seems too old and not all information up to date. For example "more", when "less" is modern version. 
Also, there is no chance to think on correct answer if you mistook. However, it's free. So... thanks for it.  
(2) is very nice structured handbook. As I've already read "The Linux Command Line" by William Shotts, all that information
helped me to remember basics.
